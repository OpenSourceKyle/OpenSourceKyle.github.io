Focus/Why: Assemble group of open-minded, action-oriented men to inspire and support each other through their goals and lives. Most importantly, I hope to make it fun, entertaining, and interesting.
ACTION is always the goal -- get feedback, ideas, or support from others

Platform: Discord, Facebook -- Video & Audio required

Who: Keep size small and cozy at 4-8 dudes total. We can cycle new dudes in and out as schedules or restrictions arise.

### YES:
- family man with good insights and very open-minded
- dude still achieving

### MAYBE:

- "too busy" but a lot of good business mindset

When/How often: 30-60mins (scale to group size) every 2 weeks on Sunday (morning/afternoon/evening?)

# Rules:

- Action first
- Respect each other
- Confidentiality
- Bring VALUE to the group
- Serious but fun -- no fucking memes
