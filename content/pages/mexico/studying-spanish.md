# Intro

##### *Note: I use the word Mexicans in this article. Although in the U.S. we are sensitive to this, I am using Mexican in the technical sense -- people from Mexico. Having lived in Mexico for a while, Latino is typically an uncommon word, and Hispanic is absolutely made up and offensive. I am respecting the people I love by correctly labeling them by their present-day nationality and culture.*

My whole life, it seemed there were always Mexicans around me while I was growing up. Although that sounds funny or ignorant, but it's the honest truth. I came from a small family of just me and my parents -- we were not close with any other relatives. So when we went out and saw these (typically big) Mexican families, I always had a sense of jealousy and desire for belonging. Big picnics, cookouts, music, fun, games, etc. -- and instead, I was alone with my dysfunctional parents, likely enduring some public fight they were prone to having.

I did not start learning Spanish until high school, and surprisingly that seemed early growing up in the South. I feel that my school did their best, and I had thought I learned a lot. However, after more time studying and living in a Spanish-speaking place, I realized I learned very little. Aside from knowing when my Puerto Rican ladyfriend's dad** called me *maricón* in high school, what I learned then served me very little (though inspired me a lot).

> ****He ended up loving me because I understood his joking insult in that moment**

Nearly a decade later, I moved to Texas and begun true progress in my Spanish journey. I was frustrated by (always) being surrounded by so many Spanish speakers of various levels and not understanding a thing. After leaving the military and being re-energized to get out more after the pandemic, I put myself in Spanish night classes for adults. **This was my true beginning**. I finally started putting in effort -- real effort.
# Details

Learning Spanish has been one of the most rewarding parts of my experience living in Mexico. Before moving, I had tried a few different methods to get myself to a conversational level, and after arriving, I realized just how much further I still had to go (and how un-conversational I was). I will share some of the practical methods I used that helped me get better over time -- methods that were realistic and fit into my busy life.

## No Quick Fixes

**There are absolutely no shortcuts or easy methods. The best method is the one you stick with. No, it isn't harder to learn as an adult (because you likely are more disciplined and know better how you learn) -- this is an excuse.**

Your personal learning style and, most importantly, *what you can stick with consistently* will drive your progress. I tried several things: group classes, flashcards, listening exercises, and private tutoring. Each one had its own place in my learning process.

In the beginning, **group classes** were excellent because they offered social interaction and kept me motivated. I don't recommend starting with one-on-one tutoring unless you're already at a high level, as it can be isolating and boring. Now that I've reached a more advanced stage, I find private tutoring useful for diving deeper into Mexican history, slang, and cultural nuances -- things that even some native speakers might not know. At this level, it becomes less about the basics and more about understanding cultural context and subtleties.

### Perseverance Over Speed

Learning a language doesn't happen overnight. It takes time (probably years), and it's important not to rush or expect instant results. I'm in my 30s, and while I may not cognitively learn as quickly as I did in my younger years, **my better dedication, perseverance, and discipline have allowed me to keep improving (more than I did when I was younger)**. Learning a language is like any other worthwhile pursuit -- it requires patience and consistent effort, but the rewards are more than worth it.

### Write Things Down Once

Write new words, phrases, or grammars concepts at least once -- even if you never look at it again. Just do it -- I learned way more than I expected without even needing to review things all the thing. 

### Emotions while Learning

I think it's important to mention: **I had many, constant ups and downs while learning**. Some days I understand everything in Spanish, and other days I think about going back to my home country with my tail between my legs.

I had plenty of days where I thought: "I'm never gonna figure out Spanish" or "I'm too old, dumb, lazy, tired, etc." -- but you know what? I didn't stop. I did my best, still went to bed every night, and woke up the next day feeling better than before. Emotions can be your friends or enemies -- or they can just exist. You don't have to always trust or listen to them -- just keep going.

I also say: it's okay to take breaks. None of my study was continuous either. My method of learning is best described as sprints (1-2 months) than a marathon (semesters to years), but this needs to be tailored to the person. I typically took breaks when I got tired, bored, or felt that I had better things to do... this gave me plenty of time to get excited again and get back it!

## First Start in the US: Night Classes and Duolingo

I originally planned to get good enough to talk to *pochos* in Texas, but later my ex and I decided to move out of the US post-pandemic. I enrolled myself in **night classes** at a local high school through a community program, which was instrumental to getting me from knowing virtually nothing to having a basic level of understanding. I did this for about a year, which gave me a foundation in reading, speaking, and understanding Spanish. It wasn't perfect, but it was a significant first step. I took **MANY NOTES** -- damn near every word, phrase, rule, etc. I wrote it down. Even if I never looked at it again (which was sometimes the case), **I at least wrote everything down once**.

I also started using [**Duolingo**](https://www.duolingo.com/) early on. While it's often criticized, and I agree it has limitations, I found it helpful as a daily practice tool. I spent **15-30 minutes/day seeing, thinking, and hearing new Spanish words**. It's not enough to get you fluent, but it's a good way to get started if you're just beginning -- especially with basic vocabulary. Once you start feeling like Duolingo isn't adding value anymore, it's okay to move on to other tools. Duolingo is also like playing slot machines in Vegas, so I don't believe it to be useful long-term (and so many people have streaks and mediocre language skills).

I tried various beginner-level **podcasts** and some news at this stage, but I found it difficult to understand or stick with. The only one I've ever liked is [Spanishland School Podcast](https://spanishlandschool.com/category/podcast/) because the speaker articulates clearly and slowly while covering helpful grammar rules. I have gotten great value out of her podcast and email newsletter. She is Colombian, but that will not affect your ability to learn or comprehend Mexican Spanish.

## Next in Mexico: Vocab Building with Anki

One of the best tools I discovered after arriving in Mexico was [**Anki**](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), a flashcard app that lets you create personalized decks. Every time I heard a *new word, read something unfamiliar, or struggled to remember a particular term*, **I'd add it to my Anki deck**. The trick is to not overwhelm yourself with trying to memorize every single word -- focus on the ones you keep encountering or know will be useful (e.g. *ir, hablar, escuchar, etc.*).

> ****The link above is Ankiweb, the website. There are Anki phone apps as well. It is a little confusing to distinguish the project, online version, and apps, but just follow the link above on your phone.**

I dedicated **five to ten minutes every morning** to reviewing these flashcards, normally while I was on the toilet, *gross*. It was a manageable amount of time, even on busy days, and over time, it really helped build a solid vocabulary. The key is consistency -- it's not about cramming but about steady, daily progress. Baby steps every day.

Speaking of building vocabulary, I used [SpanishDictionary](https://www.spanishdict.com/) to look up words on its phone app, but I've moved on to mostly a [custom GPT in ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to understand slang and idiomatic phrases at this point. Here's my prompt (not the same as a custom GPT but close enough) for anyone else to use -- copy and paste it in a new conversation:

```
**PROMPT:**

You are a native _Chilango_, born and raised in Mexico City. You are fluent in both American English and Mexican Spanish, and you can easily explain nuances and convert between both languages. Your goal is to help translate and explain slang, idioms, and colloquial expressions effectively.

When responding, follow this format:

1. **INPUT:** (the user's question or phrase).
2. **OUTPUT:** (the definition or explanation, with the meaning underlined after the words "describir" or "significa").
3. **Examples:** (sentences or contexts in which the word or phrase is used).
4. **Feelings:** (explanation of the tone or emotional connotation of the word or phrase).

Use a conversational and accessible tone in Mexican Spanish, but provide English translations when requested. If the user makes grammatical or typographical errors, correct them and offer an improved version. Maintain a clear and direct tone, prioritizing natural and fluent language.
```

### More Advanced Listening Practice

After reaching an intermediate level ([B1/B2 for those who know the certification tests](https://www.tellmeinspanish.com/learning/levels-of-spanish/#B1)), I started listening to more random things in Spanish for **daily listening practice** -- podcasts, audiobooks, random YouTube videos, songs, etc. This doesn't have to be anything formal. I would often listen to Spanish audiobooks or podcasts for **five to ten minutes each morning**.

I started with familiar content, like *Harry Potter*, because I already knew the storyline, which made it easier to follow along in a new language. Listening every day helped tune my ear to the rhythm and sounds of Spanish, making real-life conversations more understandable.

## Studying in Mexico City

Studying Spanish in Mexico City has been the most impactful way to learn and improve my Spanish. Even though I took Spanish classes before and thought I had a functional grasp of the language, I quickly realized after moving to Mexico that no amount of apps or classes had prepared me for living in the language.

**You absolutely have to live in the language eventually to reach fluency**.

### Why Mexico City?

Mexico City was an easy choice for me. It's close to Texas, making it easy to travel back and forth to the US, and it's the cultural and political capital of the country. It's the 2nd largest city in Latin America (but bigger than NYC) and has deep historical significance, being home to the Aztec or Mexica capital and many other pre-Hispanic cultures. I always describe it as the "New York of Latin America" -- a massive, diverse, and energetic city that offers endless opportunities for language and culture.

### Choosing a Spanish School

If you're serious about learning Spanish, enrolling in a formal school can provide structure and discipline. I chose [**CEPE (Centro de Enseñanza para Extranjeros)**](https://cepe.unam.mx/), which is a Spanish-learning program run by **UNAM**, one of Mexico's most prestigious universities. CEPE is technically part of UNAM but operates independently, catering specifically to foreigners. While UNAM itself is free for Mexican students, CEPE is a paid program that anyone can attend.

I highly recommend CEPE. The experience is immersive, and you get exposure to a real university environment while also being in a foreign-language program. You'll meet people from all over the world -- international students, travelers, journalists, newly divorcees (me), and working professionals -- who are all learning Spanish together.

The program runs year-round in **two-month intervals**, with morning and afternoon classes available. Morning sessions are more popular, while afternoon classes come at a discount. I recommend morning classes to make more friends and have an overall better experience.

### Social Experience and Integration

One of the best aspects of studying at CEPE is the diverse student population. You'll find two main types of students:

1. **International students (20-somethings)** from places including but not limited to Japan, Korea, Germany, and Canada studying abroad.
2. **Older professionals and travelers (30s, 40s, and beyond)** taking a break from work or life to explore the world.

While the program is conducted purely in Spanish at all levels, **English is often the *de facto* language outside the classroom** among international students. However, your experience will be much more fulfilling if you make an effort to communicate in Spanish.

When I arrived, I placed into **Level 4 (out of 8 levels)**, and I can't emphasize enough how important it is to study before arriving. Coming in with some Spanish knowledge will save you time, money, and improve your experience significantly. If you arrive with zero Spanish, you'll struggle to integrate and might find yourself relying too much on foreign friends and the "foreigner bubble."

### The Best Class to Take: Dance

At CEPE, students take **core Spanish classes** alongside **cultural electives**. Options include Mexican history, literature, and even photography. While these classes sound interesting, I found most of them to be low-energy and not very engaging.

**Take the dance class.**

In Latin America, dance is a fundamental part of social life. **Salsa, cumbia, and bachata** are everywhere, and learning to dance will instantly improve your social experience. Instead of sitting in a classroom, you're actively moving and socializing.

I took the dance class every session (sometimes doubling up or teaching) while studying Spanish, and it was one of the best decisions I made. I have more fun socially in parties with locals because I speak their language and can dance (good enough ha). I even met my ex-girlfriend in my dance class, and I've seen many others form strong friendships or relationships through dance.

# Action

1) Set a daily reminder (alarm or task) on your smartphone shortly after you wake up: at least 5 days/week (Mon-Fri) or everyday
2) 5 minutes on Duolingo
3) 5 minutes studying Anki flashcards
4) 10 minutes listening to a Spanish podcast or YouTube video
5) 1-3 days/week Sign up for a Spanish class; if your level is intermediate, immerse yourself in a country that speaks it

I only recommend tutoring at an intermediate-high or higher level because there are so many good free resources for beginners.

**Take notes and improve your practice!**
