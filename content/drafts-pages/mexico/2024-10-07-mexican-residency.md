When I decided to apply for residency in Mexico, I wasn't sure what to expect. I'd been living here for over six months, taking Spanish classes, and getting comfortable with the culture. Here, I'll share my journey through the process to help anyone considering the same move.

### Choosing the Residency Type

There are different types of residency options, but I opted for temporary residency to start. I technically qualified for permanent residency, but I wanted to take it slow and learn more about the requirements. Permanent residency is often intended for retirees, and I wanted to be sure I was prepared for everything it entailed. To apply, you must meet certain financial requirements—these are either a specific monthly income for six months or a set amount in savings for 12 months. I decided to pursue the consulate with the most lenient requirements, which happened to be one in Texas. This was convenient since I was planning a visit to the U.S. anyway.

### The Facebook Groups and Facilitators

There's a whole ecosystem of Facebook groups, facilitators, and "helpers" out there for people trying to get residency. Personally, I found them to be mostly unhelpful. Many of these groups and services come with inflated egos, high fees, and promises they can rarely guarantee (or the promise that they can't guarantee anything). Most of the facilitators are simply there to guide you through paperwork and maybe wait in line for you, but they can't actually help with the consulate part. If you speak Spanish, it's  feasible to do everything on your own. That said, if you don't speak the language, their services might be more useful.

### Part #1: Consulate (your home country)

One thing that surprised me was how tricky it was to book an appointment. Forget about using the online appointment system; it simply didn't work. Instead, I emailed several consulates, and while some took weeks to respond, I was lucky with Texas. They offered me an appointment in about a week and a half. My advice: email multiple consulates and be flexible. If you're in a rush, this process can be frustrating, so give yourself plenty of time to wait for responses.

Before I arrived for my appointment, the consulate staff provided me with a list of all the documents I needed. These included my passport, color copies, and 12 months of bank statements. I used statements from my Roth IRA to meet the savings requirement. I also made sure to talk to the consulate officer in Spanish, explaining that I'd been living in Mexico for several months and was studying Spanish. I think this helped; showing genuine interest in Mexico beyond just being a cheap place to live seemed to matter.

### Part #2: Immigration Office (in Mexico)

Once I received my visa from the consulate, I had 180 days to enter Mexico, and then 30 days to visit an immigration office to complete the process. Specifically for Mexico City, this part involves showing up early—sometimes as early as 4 or 5 a.m.—to wait in line. There's no appointment system, just a first-come, first-served setup. My first attempt was on a holiday I didn't know about, which meant I waited for hours only to be turned away. So, check for local holidays before you go! (I did but the internet lied)

On my second visit, I arrived later in the day and waited. This worked since my schedule was flexible, though it meant returning the next day. The process involved providing more copies of documents, filling out an application, and getting my photograph and fingerprints taken. Eventually, they handed me my residency card—a tangible symbol that I had made it through the hoops.

### Final Costs and Reflections

The total cost for me was about \$450 USD, including both the U.S. consulate and Mexican immigration fees and not including travel. I did everything myself without paying for facilitators, and didn't encounter many issues besides that initial holiday mishap. I think the key to my success was showing that I genuinely wanted to be part of Mexico—**I was learning the language, engaging with the culture, and treating the country as more than just a cheap getaway**.

If you're planning to go through this process, my advice is to be patient, do your research, and if possible, learn some Spanish. There are many guides and videos online, and Facebook groups can help with specific questions, but if you're prepared to put in the effort, you can do this yourself. For me, it was worth every minute.
