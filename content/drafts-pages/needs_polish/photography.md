# --- BASIC CONTROLS --- 

 

 

PRIORITY MODES (presets): 

• auto: camera handles everything; usually trash 

• portrait: wide aperture (low f-stop and blurry) and maybe facial recognition 

• macro: up-close/magnify subjects 

• landscape: narrow aperture (high f-stop) for big scenes 

• S | SHUTTER: manual ISO and shutter speed; auto aperture 

• A | APERTURE: manual ISO and aperture; auto shutter speed 

• M | MANUAL: everything manual 

• P | PROGRAM: manual ISO, white balance, and flash; auto shutter speed and aperture 

 

 

• APERTURE/f-stop: opening of the lense; allows in a certain amount of light; high f-stop (e.g. f/22 vs. f/2.8) means lets in little light (bright subjects); also limits amount of focus 

• SHUTTER SPEED: length of time shutter stays open (movement of subject); e.g. 1/250 (of second) is fast; linked to aperture: faster shutter needs wide (low f-stop) aperture 

• ISO: light sensitivity; higher ISO collects more light (brighter light); e.g. 100 ny day but 800 dim room
