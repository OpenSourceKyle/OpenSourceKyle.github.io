## Nerdy Details of Website Build

- **Platform/Software Stack:**
  - [Cursor AI: Code Editor](https://www.cursor.com/) provides use of [ChatGPT: AI Assistant](https://chatgpt.com/) and [Claude: AI Assistant](https://claude.ai/) models for code creation and editing.
  - ChatGPT is used separately for article editing and grammar checking.
  - Content (words, not code) is written by me, but AI tools are my editors.
  - [GitHub: Version Control](https://github.com/) stores, builds, and deploys my code to [GitHub Pages: Website Hosting](https://pages.github.com/) using [Hugo: Static Site Generator](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the website from my code templates.
  - My website theme is a [custom-built Hugo theme](https://github.com/OpenSourceKyle/hugo-opensourcekyle-theme) tailored to my liking and constantly updated.
  - I use [Unsplash: Free Stock Photos](https://unsplash.com/) and [DALL-E AI: Image Generation](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/) to add images to my content.
  - I personally code off of an obscure operating system called [Arch Linux: Linux Distribution](https://archlinux.org/) because I was a l33t h4x0r back in the day; now, I love it and can't stand to use anything else.
