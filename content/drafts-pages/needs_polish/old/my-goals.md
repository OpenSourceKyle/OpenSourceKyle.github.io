# Life Purpose: I exist to facilitate connections with others

**NOTE: this is out-of-date and similar though not wholly reflective of what I think currently**

## A Vow of Poverty

* accept no money for the info, knowledge, or insights
* open-source and license for greatest exposure, sharing, and robustness for non-commercial usage
* Lindy effect: make it last, where reasonable, for as much as possible
* seek greatness and difficulty for its own sake as a virtue
* help but delegate where appropriate; this saves oneself from irritation and provides opportunity to grow through instruction
* for myself, I have decoupled the necessity to work to live; therefore, I have the opportunity to use my brain to accomplish and not waste it on menial tasks

> "Seeds planted today, will grow to towering trees tomorrow, which will bear fruit much sweeter than we could ever imagine" -Simón Bolívar

## Elevator Pitch

This explains **what** I am doing in an interesting, open, and vulnerable way while not being negative, overly detailed, or qualifying...

I am cultivating my creativity and expression through:

- guitar
- photography
- Spanish
- journaling

I am experimenting with my:

- appearance
- style
- piercings
- tattoos
- name

Professionally, I bartend and automate computer testing. I have a couple of degrees. I have a goal of living in a Spanish-speaking country, and I can read, write, speak, and use my technology in Spanish. I am training gymnastics-lite with difficult body movements like handstands, muscle ups, front levers, and planches. 

My interest include:

- nature
- beauty
- self-improvement
- music
- fitness

I am working to open-source my ideas and philosophy fully.

## Goals

### Cultivate a healthy, confident, and attractive **mindset**

Mindset is the most important level of growth for me to make. This mindset plays into the "vibe" that a lot of people (especially women) subconsciously intuit.

Having a solid mindset will:

- keep me stable through difficult times
- help me make good decisions
- bolster my attractiveness
- allow me to be confident and unashamed of my actions

#### Actions:

##### Sleep

My greatest struggle, but the most important for a solid brain, mood, and vibe:

- Goal: sleep 7-8hrs/night
- Chill time: 11pm ; stretching, deep breathing, and meditation before sleeping -- practice relaxation (parasympathetic) response when the least stressed
- Bedtime: 0000-0730
- Minimize: waking up in the middle of the night
  - any middle of the night wakeups -- get out of bed and walk or read BUT do not continue laying in bed
- Continue: using ear plugs, light-blocking sleep mask, and sound machine
- No: screens (aside from eReader) an hour before bed and/or use blue-light blocking apps and glasses
- Bed is only sleeping -- Pavlovian conditioning where the brain and body associate the bed with anything not sleep-related

##### Diet

My second greatest struggle, though I have improved a lot. This will help play into good vibes and feelings internally as well as improved sleep and athletic performance:

- create my own cookbook of simple, healthy, protein-focused meals (that I already make! -- I tend to forget my options)
- look into Chris Heria's meal prep videos
- forgive myself on binge days
- continue eating protein powder and yogurt/smoothie mix
- focus on eating plenty of healthy food to satiation and not stopping early
- create daily eating schedule with times, proportions, food options, etc.

##### Affirmations

- "I love you"-mirror exercises 3x/ea morning
- _No More Mr. Nice Guy_'s list of affirmations on the fridge

##### Guitar

- pick up the guitar everyday
- follow guitar lessons practice tasks
- finger dexterity

##### Journaling

- Continue enjoying the process of writing: notebook, HP journal, forum, Google Keep notes

##### Exercise

- I have a set schedule, but I also do more than I am scheduled for... makes me feel like a boss
- Hold a handstand for 10+ seconds without a support or moving around
- Be able to run 6 miles without stopping

##### Photography

- Create my own instructions for camera settings... these are pretty overwhelming
- Take 1 picture/day
- Aim to get some good "professional" shots of myself and activities

##### Moderation of substances

- Limiting going out or staying out late will mitigate most of this

## Have more meaningful sexual, romantic, and intimate experiences

- continue dressing stylish, tattoos/piercings, tanning, being well-groomed, and smelling good
- being open, honest, emotional, and sexual -- BUT not being devastated from a rejection
- keep slimming down... life starts at 12% and remember my face is usually +2% bodyfat than my average
- deepening connections with compatible lovers -- I personally prefer more intimate (deeper) connections; the trust and connection/bond is much more enjoyable than novelty for me generally

### Relationship Needs

These needs are listed for specificity and clarity and are desired to be shown to a reasonable extent. Demonstrating these over the period of a day or week would be appreciated so long as schedules, commitments, and life allow.

These needs have been written with a “me-first” focus and are not written in relation or retribution to anyone else intentionally.

* Physical presence
  * I want a relationship based in the physical realm
  * I want a partner that is present in the physical realm as much as reasonably possible
  * I do not want a long-distance relationship
  * I do not want a relationship where I feel like I must compete with screens
* Physical touch
  * Public Displays of Affection
* Quality time
  * Emotional presence
  * Fun activities
  * Chores or life maintenance
* I want my feelings to be factored into major life decisions, even if the decision does not directly involve me
* Trusting me enough to keep me involved first on big life decisions, even if they are difficult or could cause emotional upset
* I deserve to advocate for myself and ensure that the relationship provides me what I am looking for in life
  * If it does not, then I owe it to myself to communicate clearly and in the event of the relationship is not resolvable, to end the relationship
* Happiness, Contentment, Safety, and Security
  * I do not expect a relationship to always be easy or positive, but I do not want a relationship that provides a burden or that does not make happy
