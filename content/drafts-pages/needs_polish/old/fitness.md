# Fitness
- create fitness plans
- workout templates:
   - coach potato plan: calisthenics 2x/wk + walking 3-4x/wk (active recovery on off days)
      - list calisthenic progressions based on ability/fitness levels
   - no gym plan: basically couch potato or bodyweight program with dumbbells exercises?
   - lifiting 3-4x/wk fullbody (upper/lower split) -- focus big lifts
   - bodybuilder (intermediate-advanced): 6x/wk brosplit
   - MORE walking (rule of thumb for 10,000 steps/day or 4-4.5 miles/day)
   - incorporate active recovery
   - Gym vs at-home workout -- physical locations and associations matter
      - GYM doesn't have to be lifting... can be calisthenics and cardio machines as well as place to focus
   - schedule/time-of-day that is easiest and best feeling to maintain
   - stretching, massages, foam rolling, dynamic warmups, injury prevention/mitigation/therapy
- Supplements:
   - Multivitamin
   - Fish oils 1000mg/day of Omega-3 (NOT just the oil mass)
   - Creatine 5g/day
   - Caffeine 100mg/workout
   - APPETITE SUPPRESSION ONLY: Ephedrine 25 mg/5 days out of the week (CAUTION - requires cycling, doctor approval, and ensuring that this will not worsen cardiovascular issues such as hypertension)
   - ** CAUTION about stims' (caffeine and ephedrine) effects on sleep **
- diets:
   - recipes:
      - turkey + lentil crumble with variations
      - protein fruit smoothie
      - costco meals
      - snack/fruit/veggy trays
   - intuitive eating or simple plans
- Goal tracking
   - write down routines and exercises
   - body weight scale, tape body parts, fat caliper, controlled (lighting, position, flexing, location, etc.) body pictures, and DEXA scans
   - easy habit building
   - easy long-term compliance goals
      - walk everyday
      - exercises 2x/wk
      - do mornings or lunch breaks when otherwise time is wasted
      - do “wasteful” activities while walking like listening to music, podcasts, etc. to double efficiency
      - be okay with failure -- feel the emotions, move on, reset, and don't give up
      - long-term compliance is not perfect but up and down -- goal is to shift that up-and-down upwards or to flatten those ups-and-downs
      - etc.
- Sleep and bedtime routines:
   - Track sleep (initially but not obsessively)
      - 7-9hrs/night
   - Exercise caffeine tablets 100mg in the morning to workout
- General Hygiene and Health:
   - daily showers
   - lotion face, body, and sun-expose portions
   - retinol
   - grooming head, facial, and body hair
   - deodorant + cologne
- Style:
   - nice clothes + shoes
   - hats
   - accessories
   - talk to strangers
   - tricks, interesting openers, interests
   - focus on being confident and more emotionally intelligent/aware vs. logical, boring, and predictable -- respect is always important
