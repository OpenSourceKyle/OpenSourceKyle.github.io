**NOTE: this was a workout plan/research that I conducted for someone looking to "bimbo-fy" themselves --  their stated goal was to be more "bimbo-like"**

# Ideas

## GOAL:
* Gain muscle and strength
* Become bimbo
* Gain self-esteem and confidence

### MEASURE:
* height
* age
* weight
* maybe DEXA scan?
* photos: good “standard” lighting & flexed and unflexed
* fat caliper measurements
* tape measure
  * Male: “Adonis Index”

    * **RESEARCH MORE**: waist, butt, and arm trainers?

Light Calisthenics & Stretching during work

Lifting: Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri from 0730-0930 (2hrs for travel/walk, warmup/stretching, lifting, and shower)
* daily caffeine dosage on workout or work days only (Mon-Fri) 100mg before workout
* creatine stretching/warmup routine
*  rip off a Stephanie Buttermore routine and simplify or focus on ass
* squats and ass 2x/week in 10-15reps/set range for hypertrophy
* make compatible with home or gym
* MAX of 5 lifts per workout for simplicity
* Schedule and plan monthly compliance rewards (unrestricted cheat days)
**RESEARCH MORE**: nerd neck and posture fix like facepulls or posture correctors (tape or brace)

Make spreadsheet tracker for lifting

Walking: offdays or everyday -- no distance goal just morning

Diet: healthy whole foods
* Make eating schedule to eat 3x/day & use phone alarms for first [few] weeks during workweek (Mon-Fri)
* Breakfast: 0930-1000 (before or during 1st work meeting)
* Lunch: 1300 (before nap)
* Dinner: 1800 (before outdoor activity)
* protein shake/day : 50g/shake minimum
* 1 dark chocolate serving allowed per day after DINNER ONLY
* snack trays
* CALORIE COUNT/LIMIT “bad” foods to 200 cal/day

HOMEWORK FOR BIMBO:
* create “Bad Bitch” hype workout playlist of 1-2hrs of music
  * additionally, select a few pre-made workout playlists that you like
* buy gatorade (1 Liter) workout bottle
* select protein powder that you enjoy, jives with allergies, and will help hit 50g/shake
* pick role model/bimbo as well as define “bimbo” for yourself to keep it healthy, authentic, etc.
  * Samples to filter:
