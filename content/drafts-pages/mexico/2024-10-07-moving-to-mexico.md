Preparing for Life in Mexico: My Experience Before the Move

Moving to Mexico is an adventure, but there are some key things you need to take care of before making the leap. Here, I’ll share what I did to prepare, from learning Spanish to figuring out logistics like mail and finances. Hopefully, this helps you avoid some of the pitfalls I encountered and makes your transition smoother.

### Learning Spanish Before the Move

The most important thing I did before moving to Mexico was to learn Spanish. I had some background from high school, but honestly, that wasn’t very useful beyond a few basic words and some pronunciation practice. So, I took matters into my own hands—starting with Duolingo and eventually signing up for night classes at a local high school while still in the U.S. Twice a week, after work, I would attend these classes. Most of the students were older, but it was a great environment for me to practice speaking with others at my level.

Eventually, I took a trip to Mexico City, not just to the touristy areas, but to actually use my Spanish. It was a humbling experience. Despite my studies, I realized I still had a lot to learn. But it made the trip more enjoyable, and every interaction was more meaningful because I was making the effort to communicate in Spanish. If you’re serious about living in a Spanish-speaking country, you need to put in the effort to learn the language—it will make a huge difference in your ability to integrate and feel less isolated.

### Virtual Mailbox: A Lifesaver

Another important preparation was setting up a **virtual mailbox**. This service acts like a PO box, but it’s more flexible. Unlike traditional PO boxes, which can be cumbersome and require in-person visits, a virtual mailbox lets you manage your mail from anywhere. I used it for receiving important mail like bank statements, credit cards, and insurance documents. It also allows you to have items scanned so you can read them digitally, and even have important packages forwarded to Mexico. The cost was reasonable—about $100 a year if paid annually—and it saved me from having to rely on friends or family back in the U.S.

### Setting Up Phone Service

When it comes to phone service, I started with a **virtual SIM** that provided data coverage in Mexico. This worked well initially, giving me access to data, which is crucial for apps like WhatsApp and Google Maps. However, it was somewhat expensive, at $30 a month for just data. Eventually, I switched to a local carrier, **Telcel**, which cost about $7 a month. Local plans often come with unlimited data for apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram, which is perfect for staying connected without draining your data plan.

Additionally, I transferred or ported my US numbers to Google Voice ($20 one-time fee) to be able to make and receive phone calls from important things like banks.

### Finances: Credit Cards and International Transfers

Handling finances in Mexico can be tricky, especially if you’re relying on U.S. bank accounts. Many places in Mexico still prefer cash, especially outside major cities. To make my life easier, I signed up for international fintech accounts with **Wise** and **Revolut** before I moved. Wise was particularly helpful because it offers local currency accounts, which meant I could hold pesos directly and make transfers without huge fees. Revolut served as a backup, in case there were any issues with my Wise account. Having these accounts set up at least a month before moving was crucial, as it takes time to get everything sorted and receive the physical cards.

### Short-Term Lodging

For short-term lodging, I initially used **Airbnb** to secure a place before I arrived in Mexico. While it can be a bit more expensive than other options, it provides peace of mind. You know exactly where you’ll be staying, and you’re less likely to run into scams compared to dealing directly with landlords. I’ve heard horror stories from friends who tried to arrange housing without using a platform like Airbnb and ended up getting scammed. Paying a bit more for a reliable place is worth it, especially for your first few weeks in a new country.

### Key Takeaways

- **Learn Spanish**: The number one thing that will help you integrate and enjoy your time in Mexico is speaking the language. Apps like Duolingo are a good start, but real-world practice is invaluable.
- **Virtual Mailbox**: Essential for keeping a U.S. address for financial and administrative needs. It’s flexible and allows you to manage your mail without relying on others.
- **Local SIM Cards**: Start with a virtual SIM for data, but switch to a local carrier once settled. It’s cheaper and comes with perks like unlimited data for key apps.
- **Fintech Banking**: Set up international accounts like Wise and Revolut before moving. They make currency conversion and transfers much simpler and more affordable.
- **Airbnb for Lodging**: Use Airbnb or similar platforms for your initial stay. It’s safer and more reliable than trying to arrange housing on the ground without any prior knowledge.

Moving to Mexico requires some preparation, but taking these steps made my transition much smoother. Each of these measures helped me adapt to a new environment, allowing me to focus on enjoying the experience rather than dealing with logistical headaches.
