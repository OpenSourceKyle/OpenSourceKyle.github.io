# Intro

I have been a big fan of psychedelics for how much they gave helped me grow emotionally and ease various other mental burdens (nothing heavy per se but helping with a more positive outlook). Previously, the only psychedelics that I had tried were mushrooms, but a friend expressed interest in trying [Ayahuasca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) for the first time and invited me.

Since this was sort of my life my first time again, I will describe my experience here. I had previously worked at a psychedelic center, and although I chose to not partake in that moment, I observed and learned a little more about ayahuasca.

## Cleansing the Body Beforehand: "La Dieta"

Ayahuasca seems to be more ceremony-orientated that most other psychedelics. Leading up to the ceremony, I followed the recommended [**ayahuasca diet** or "la dieta"](https://www.soul-herbs.com/ayahuasca-la-dieta/), which includes abstaining from animal products, processed foods, alcohol, drugs, sex, and excessive stimulation like music or social media for at least two weeks. I wasn't perfect, but I did my best.

My rough routine was before the ceremony was:
- <2 weeks: I mostly cooked for myself, avoiding processed foods, fast food, and sweets
- <1 week: I transitioned to a diet of eggs, fish, fruits, and simple vegetables
- <5 days: I went vegetarian (almost vegan except some cream in the tomato soup)
- <2 days: I began fasting and went exactly 48 hours without food before taking ayahuasca

Beyond the diet, I also minimized external distractions to normalize dopamine. I cut down on music (canceled my Spotify subscription), switching to white noise and binaural beats instead of having Spotify constantly playing. I also took time to journal, meditate, and be more mindful, though I wasn't perfect with consistency.

## Going to the Ceremony: in Mazunte, Mexico

Mazunte is a small town near Puerto Escondido (where I flew in and stayed), known for its peaceful vibe and natural beauty. My friend had already been there for a couple of weeks, following **the diet** strictly. I arrived a day before the ceremony, explored a bit, and spent the day drinking coconut water (while fasting), and watching the sunset. Mazunte itself is very remote, so getting there involved a flight to Puerto Escondido followed by a 1-long drive on winding roads.

The ceremony location was even more remote -- set up in a simple, primitive environment outside of town. There was no phone service, and the place was minimalistic: a small house of the shaman (somewhere between a shack and a home), an outdoor composting toilet (aka a hole in the ground), and a large hut-like structure where the ceremony would take place. It wasn't luxurious, but that was the point -- the focus was entirely on the experience.

## Drinking the Ayahuasca

The ceremony started at night. Our small group consisted of me, my friend, a woman from Germany, her translator, and a woman from Oaxaca. The shaman prepared the space with candles, burning camphor, and soft background music -- binaural beats and meditative sounds. Before the ayahuasca, he gave us small seeds (similar to chia seeds) to swallow with water, though I'm not sure of their purpose.

When it was time, the shaman served the ayahuasca in small cups, instructing us to drink it quickly without lingering on the taste. He had sweetened it slightly, and to me, it tasted like smoky barbecue sauce -- unexpected but not unpleasant. He told us to lie down and relax, letting the effects settle in. If we didn't feel anything after an hour, we could ask for more.

## What I Felt

At first, I wasn't sure if I felt anything. But after about 1 hour, I started seeing faint visual patterns -- colorful, repeating triangles making up everything. Then, I was hit with an overwhelming wave of exhaustion. I felt like I passed out, yet I remained conscious.

For what seemed like hours, I was flooded with **memories from every stage of my life** -- childhood, high school, military service, past travels, friendships, and relationships. I relived them as an observer and as if I were truly there again, feeling everything as if it were happening in real time.

I cried the entire time. Not out of sadness, but out of **pure joy and gratitude**. Even memories I had once viewed negatively felt beautiful. **The experience showed me that life is only as negative as I choose to see it**. The love, friendships, and experiences I've had are overwhelmingly positive -- I just don't always recognize them that way.

This realization hit me hard: **My life is good. It has always been good. I just needed to see it that way. And even if it's not, it's my choice on how it is.**

## Reflections

When the effects wore off, I laid there, emotionally drained, and my head hurt (like all the brain "juices" had been squeezed out). The shaman continued playing music -- flutes, guitars, and his own singing -- which added to the atmosphere. One woman in our group had a much more intense experience -- crying, laughing, and vomiting throughout the night. My friend, on the other hand, felt nothing at all.

By morning, I felt completely wiped out, dehydrated, and mentally exhausted, similar to the comedown from psychedelics or an intense emotional release. We talked briefly and rested until our taxi arrived, then made our way back.

## Reflections

This experience reminded me of something important: **I get to choose how I view my life.** Even the difficult moments are part of a greater story, one that I have control over. I frame the good or bad of my life.

If there's one thing I take from this journey, it's that I want my life -- my memories, my legacy -- to be a positive and beautiful one. Not just for myself, but for those I share it with. My goal is to continue creating experiences worth remembering, filled with joy, connection, and gratitude ==> and share those experiences.

#### I very much struggle with the sharing portion

# Action

I believe that psychedelics, when done properly with preparation and intention, are incredibly powerful. At this moment, I won't list any direct actions steps to use them, but one day I will write a general guide from my experiences and routines regarding those.
