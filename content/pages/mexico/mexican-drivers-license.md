**NOTE:** technically speaking, as a foreigner in Mexico, you should be able to prove your immigration status with your residency (immigration) card. Know that you are risking it if you don't carry the card with you, but I personally have not carried my immigration card with me (as of this writing and for the last ~2 years). That said, read more of some [anecdotal experiences](https://old.reddit.com/r/mexicoexpats/comments/1gr337m/copy_of_residency_card/) and the actual law [**las secciones 1 y 2 de Artículo 16** de la **Ley de Migración** de México](https://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/LMigra.pdf). 

# Intro

When living in Mexico, having a valid form of Mexican identification is incredibly useful. Although I can use my passport or residency card for identification, carrying these important documents around every day is very unwise. From the recommendation of a roommate, I got my **Mexican driver's license** to have an official form of ID that is recognized within the country. Plus, there is no test required to get a driver's license for a car in Mexico.

# Details

## Why Get a Mexican Driver's License?

My passport or residency card can function as an ID, but they're essential documents that are harder and more time-consuming to replace if lost or stolen. A driver's license, on the other hand, is easy to replace and provides the same proof of identity and legal residence. Plus, showing a local ID can be helpful when dealing with authorities, as many may not recognize or accept a foreign driver's license.

It's a small effort that goes a long way in making life in Mexico easier, especially when it comes to proving my legal status or identity. If you're planning on living in Mexico for an extended period, I recommend getting one.

In Mexico, I didn't need to pass a driving test to get a driver's license. In **Mexico City**, for example, I didn't have to take a driving test. However, there are some exceptions, such as if you're trying to get a motorcycle license, which sometimes requires a written test. But the point being, you can get a Mexican form of identification with minimal effort.

## Practical Benefits of a Driver's License

The driver's license cost me roughly **$50 USD** at the time (paid in pesos), and it is invaluable. It's an easy form of ID to carry around, and if I were to lose it, replacing it wouldn't be nearly as stressful as losing my passport or residency card (which could put me in trouble with immigration). Although I don't plan to drive in Mexico -- driving here is hectic -- having the license serves its purpose as a form of identification.

For someone like me, who looks visibly foreign, having an official **Mexican ID** helps in interactions with authorities, making it clear that I'm legally in the country. I've heard stories of police asking for bribes or trying to hold on to people's IDs, but I've never had this happen to me. Obviously situations like this are rare and delicate, so I'm not insisting a particular way to handle it.

## The Process

* Resource: [Mexico City Driver's License Info](https://www.cdmx.gob.mx/public/InformacionTramite.xhtml?idTramite=2506)

The process of getting a driver's license in *Mexico City* is quite simple.

I did the following steps:

1) [Made an appointment online](https://app.semovi.cdmx.gob.mx/citas/), with my local **mobility or transit department**, though I found out later some locations have walk-ins (usually malls) according to friend who did it as well.
2) **[Paid online (~$1,100MXN)](https://data.finanzas.cdmx.gob.mx/formato_lc/vehicular/licencias/01)**, which is optional but requires an RFC (tax ID). You can also pay at certain convenience stores, kiosks, and other locations as another option.
3. **Printed off required documents and receipts**:
   - **Official ID**: *color copy* of my passport or residency card
   - **Utility Bill**: power, gas, or water bill with my current address (doesn't need to be the owner of the address)
   - **Proof of payment**
   - **Proof of appointment**

Once I made my appointment, I showed up with the required documents, the clerk entered my details, took my photo, collected my fingerprints, and then printed my driver's license on the spot (but not before waiting a little bit for the system to crash and come back up).

I recommend making an appointment and coming in with all the documents to make things relatively smooth, but my friend said the walk-in process was also easy.
