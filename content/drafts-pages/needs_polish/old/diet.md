## Goal: keep a sustainable, simple diet that elevates the physical and cognitive performance that I desire as well as allowing for infrequent breaks

Reference: https://youtu.be/I-xTGAQUCG0
* TLDR: oatmeal, spinach, chicken

Actions:
- create daily and weekly eating schedule
- create recipe book/page with ingredients, cooking method, macros, and dosages
- buy and surround myself with only things that I am allowed to eat
- print out feeding windows
- allow rewards (daily: cereal/smoothie/chocolate? ; weekly: healthy eating out?)

My Key Qualities that will Facilitate This:
- I am good at only eating what is around me (I do not eat or order out a lot)
- With a precise plan, I am good at following it
- I enjoy suffering sometimes lol

FAST: 1900-1100

Breakfast: 1100

Lunch: 1400

Dinner: NLT 1900
